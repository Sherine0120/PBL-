1. IDEFINE Blynk template credentials
2. Include necessary libraries (WiFi, Blynk, RTC, LCD)
3. INITIALIZE:
- RTC module
- LCD with 12C
- Pins for PIR sensor, relays, physical switch
4. SET system state variables:
- lastMotionTime = 0
- motionTimeout = 30 seconds
- systemOn = false
- systemSleeping = false
- blynkEnabled = true
5. CONNECT to WiFi and Blynk
6. DISPLAY “System ready” on LCD
Loop forever:
7. RUN Blynk background processes
8. READ physical switch state
9. IF (switch is OFF OR Blynk is OFF):
- DISPLAY status on LCD
- TURN OFF all relays
- RESET systemOn and systemSleeping flags
- WAIT briefly
- SKIP rest of loop (return)
10. IF (system is not ON and not sleeping):
- DISPLAY “System ON” on LCD
- TURN ON relays (motor and LED)
- SET systemOn = true
- RECORD current time as lastMotionTime
11. IF (motion is detected);
- UPDATE lastMotionTime
- DISPLAY “Motion Detected”
- ENSURE relays stay ON
12. OIF (no motion for 30 seconds);
- DISPLAY “Turning Off…” on LCD
- TURN OFF relays
- SET systemOn = false
- SET systemSleeping = true
13. IF (system is sleeping AND motion is detected again):
- DISPLAY “System Re-On”
- TURN ON relays
- RESET systemSleeping = false
- SET systemOn = true
- UPDATE lastMotionTIme
14. WAIT 200 ms before repeating
END LOOP
